      <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
      <div id="intro">
        <p>This easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it takes to cook some dried pasta in boiling salted water - we're talking about quick and easy options here. These amounts serve 2 but are easy to scale up or down. Remember you want about 75g of dried pasta per person - use whatever shape you've got. Or, check out my super-simple method for fresh pasta, using just flour and water.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>150 g dried spaghetti</li>
          <li class="meat">2 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon</li>
          <li>1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
          <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
          <li>30 g Parmesan cheese, plus extra for grating</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>1. Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions.</li>
          <li class="meat">Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and crispy, tossing occasionally, then turn off the heat.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in the Parmesan and mix well.</li>
          <li>Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan and toss.</li>
          <li>Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan is not too hot otherwise the eggs will scramble.</li>
          <li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.</li>
        </ol>
